You can climb the ranks and compete to be the Gorilla General that will be given Solana weekly! To find out more about becoming the Gorilla General, please come check out our Discord.

Title: The Vision
We understand that Solana NFTs is a place where people can go from a little capital to an actual sizable amount. Some people have the ability to call NFTs consistently and earn multiples of their capital. Some of these people have no influence or network. Our main goal is to give the power to the people and create a decentralized alpha group that rewards our top members. Anybody can become the General and guide our troops to victory! The real question is who will it be?
