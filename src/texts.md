We are implementing 3 new roles for the channel and the most loyal, big brain alpha players will be rewarded via sol and high ranks in our discord.

The 3 roles we plan to add are @Gorilla Recruit, @Gorilla Soldier, and @Gorilla General. The Gorilla Recruits will have access to all of the private channels and will be able to climb up the ranks if they so desire. The Gorilla Soldiers will have to prove their loyalty to the other troops by giving away helpful information to the other members, we will be monitoring the chat to find the most big brain and helpful members. There can only be one Gorilla General, the General will be rewarded 1-5 Sol a week as long as they remain in power, for a general to remain in power they will have to work harder and smarter than the soldiers in the troop. We will be monitoring the chat to see whose alpha is on point and every week I will evaluate the top three Gorilla Soldiers and put a poll up to see who is the biggest brain Gorilla.

The amount of Solana the Gorilla General gets is based on the Solana made inside the Troops Lounge. If we see the majority of the gorilla recruits/soldiers living large eating bananas then the payout will be 5 Solana. If only select troops are eating but the alpha is still powerful then a payout of 2-4 Solana. If hardly any members are winning then the Gorilla General will get a payout of 1 Sol. If a Gorilla General remains in power for over 4 weeks straight then we will give them the option of giving 4 of the soldiers of their choice 1 Solana each that the Gorilla Overlord will pay for using the royalties on the secondary market.

@Gorilla Recruit = All Holders
@Gorilla Soldier = Top 20 Recruits
@Gorilla General = Top Soldier

We also have some other big things coming for the Gorilla Discord and Troops but our goal is too under promise and over deliver, at this point the only guarantee we can make is the alpha group.
